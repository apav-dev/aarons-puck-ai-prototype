/*
 * Wrap all Puck editor CSS in a named cascade layer ("puck") so that
 * Tailwind v4 utility classes (in @layer utilities) always take priority.
 *
 * Layer order is declared in app/styles.css:
 *   puck < theme < base < components < utilities
 *
 * This means Tailwind utilities override Puck styles when they conflict,
 * while Puck styles still override browser defaults and Tailwind's base/reset.
